## Remarks

It's disabled on the title screen due to laziness. The function I use to hook the configuration options takes a pointer to the base of the object
as its first argument, and I don't know how to get that pointer without waiting for the function to be called. Luckily, it's called automatically
when the player logs in, for one reason or another. So, I just take the address down once it's called on login, and disable it on the title screen.
